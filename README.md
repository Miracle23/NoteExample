# NoteExample
Note Taking site


Set Up:

https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node

1. ensure nodejs/npm installed

2. open project and navigate to folder within a console window

3. run npm install

4. run ng serve --open


The App:

4 icons on each note.
 1.archive, 
 2.important flag,
 3.edit check (tick for saved, pen for editing) to edit just click in postit.
 4.delete

- I chose archive to just be a flag, was unsure based off spec but if it was to contain many many notes 
  I would have seperated into a seperate archived list of which would be save locally seperate.

- Export notes button will export as a csv

- click the add note button to add a new note.
